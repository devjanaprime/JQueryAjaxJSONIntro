JQuery AJAX JSON Example
========================

Something simple that uses JQuery and AJAX to get data from a JSON file (hosted elsewhere) for display on the DOM. More of an example than an intro, really, but I think the code has been commented enough to help hand hold someone who is new to AJAX and JSON, but familiar with Javascript and JQuery through the process.
